To build a minimal Linux live environment using your newly compiled kernel,  

1. **Set Up Your Build Environment**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install live-build syslinux isolinux
     ```

2. **Create a Directory for the Live Build**:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/live-build
     cd ~/live-build
     ```

3. **Initialize the Live Build**:
     ```bash
     lb config
     ```

4. **Customize the Configuration**:
   - Edit the configuration files in the `~/live-build` directory to specify your kernel and other settings:
     - You may need to create a `config/package-lists/my.list.chroot` file to include necessary packages. For a minimal build, you might include just the essential tools:
       ```
       build-essential
       linux-image-dz.saida-g09.18.11.2024
       ```

5. **Add Your Custom Kernel**:
   - Place your compiled kernel in the appropriate location. You may need to adjust the live-build configuration to point to your custom kernel. This often involves modifying the `config/bootstrap` files to include your kernel:
     ```bash
     cp /boot/vmlinuz-6.8.0 ~/live-build/
     cp /boot/initrd.img-6.8.0 ~/live-build/
     ```

6. **Build the Live Image**:
   - Run the build process to generate the ISO image:
     ```bash
     sudo lb build
     ```
   - This step can take some time as it builds the entire live environment.

7. **Locate the ISO File**:
   - Upon completion, the ISO file will be located in the `~/live-build` directory. It will typically be named something like `live-image-amd64.iso`.

8. **Test the Live Image**:
   - You can test the live image using virtualization software like VirtualBox or QEMU:
     ```bash
     qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom ~/live-build/live-image-amd64.iso -boot d
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can create a bootable USB drive using tools like `dd`:
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=~/live-build/live-image-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M
     sync
     ```
     **Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB device identifier.**

9. **Boot from the Live Environment**:
   - Restart your computer and boot from the USB or CD/DVD to enter your minimal Linux live environment.

### Additional Customizations
- **Add Configuration Files**: You can add configuration files (like `fstab`, `hosts`, etc.) to customize the live environment further.
- **Include Additional Packages**: Modify your package list to include essential tools and libraries depending on your use case.

### Summary
By following these steps, you can create a minimal Linux live environment using your custom kernel. This process can be tailored based on your specific requirements and the desired packages for your live system. If you encounter any issues, please provide specific error messages or details for further assistance.
